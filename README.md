# Online Voting System

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application where users can register, log in, create polls, vote, and view real-time voting results. The main goal of the project is to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for online voting with real-time updates and role-based access control.

## 🚀 Features

- User registration and login with secure authentication.
- Admins or authorized users can create polls.
- Each user can vote only once per poll.
- Real-time result updates without page refresh using WebSocket (Socket.io).
- Responsive user interface for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Role-based dashboard to separate normal users and admins.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose ORM)  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)  
- **Real-time updates:** Socket.io  
- **Password Hashing:** bcryptjs  
- **API Calls:** Axios

## 🎯 Why These Technologies

- **React.js**: For building a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: For building scalable and fast RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Flexible schema-less database, perfect for handling dynamic poll data.
- **JWT & bcryptjs**: For secure user authentication and password hashing.
- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time communication between client and server to show live poll results.
- **Axios**: Simplifies HTTP requests between frontend and backend.

## ⏳ Duration

This project was completed over a period of **5 months** (from **December 2024 to April 2025**) as a self-learning full-stack development project.
